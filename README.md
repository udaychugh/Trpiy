## About Tripy

<p align="justify">Have you ever planned a trip (or at least wanted to) with a group of people but didn't want to deal with splitting the costs based on each person's length of stay? Plannning with spreasheets can be tedious to split costs when not everyone may be able to stay the whole length of the trip.
With tripy you can easily split trip costs with a large group of people and get equal payments per person with differing lengths of stay.</p>

## How to Use

<ul>
  <li>Share the total expense of the trip along with number of days decided for the trip.</li>
  <li>Add everyoneâ€™s information -  name , budget for the trip and the number of days one stayed for the trip.</li>
  <li>The individual amount ought to be paid by everyone is shown to you.</li>
  <li>Anyone can download the receipt through the app for later viewing.</li>
  <li>You can pay your amount via your cards by selecting Pay option right next to your name.</li>
  <li>The green paid sign is the symbol of successful payment.</li>
</ul>
